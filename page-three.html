  <h1>About the Artist</h1>
  <h3>Hello!</h3>

  <p>Click <a href='images.html'><em>here</em></a> for a photo of me!</p>

  <p>My name is <em>Dallin Reber</em>, and I am the potter behind Clay by Dallin.
  I started my adventure in pottery in ceramics my sophomore year of high school,
  and I have been in love ever since. I started selling my work at art shows
  my junior year, and then built an Etsy shop when a senior. Since then, I have
  tried to keep creating as much as possible, and I now work as an instructor at
  the Kreative Kiln in Pleasant Grove, UT.</p>
  <p>I enjoy doing anything outdoors, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
    <li>And anything with wildlife!</li>
    </ul>
